ProxyTypeHelper
===============
June 23-2014  Changed to use SQLite instead of SQL Express local db removing requirement to have SQL Express installed.  


June 19-2014
Requires WPF 4.5. Sample includes a SQL Express local DB. Includes 64 bit EF 6.0 library but not 32bit. So you may encounter with the samples   if 32 bit and no SQL Express 2012 support. 

This is the initial commit. Fully functioning but needs a bit of polish and to add licensing details and references.
